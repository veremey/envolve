								<p class="desc__m">The Envolve Center emerged as a formal, funded collaboration in 2015 after years of a shared vision between leadership of Washington University in St. Louis and Centene Corporation. Thought leaders from both organizations envisioned an entity that could leverage the Brown School’s research expertise and Centene’s industry resources to create and implement evidence-based innovations that could concretely improve the health of vulnerable populations across the country. The Envolve Center offices are located on the Washington University campus in St. Louis, Missouri with industry partners throughout the United States.</p>
